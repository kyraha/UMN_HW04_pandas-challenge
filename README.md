# UMN_HW04_pandas-challenge
Analysis was done on a data of a (fictional?) school district. Whithout any extra research,
based only on the provided data we can come up to a few conclusions.

## Observation #1
A clear negative correlation between school size and average scores is observed.
Bigger the school - lower the scores and percentage of passing the math and reading tests.
On the other hand the size of a school also correlate with its type. Further analysis is required.

## Observation #2
Surprisingly, budget spending per student is also negatively correlated with the test scores.
One would expect students with more spending should perform better. But this is not the case
in this particular district according to the data.
Again, further analysis of relations between other variables is needed.

## Observation #3
Indeed, the sizes of the schools vary significantly for District and Charter schools (see the "Bonus" box at the bottom of the notebook).
The biggest charter school (2,283 students) is still smaller than the smallest district school (2,739 students).
Further research is required.
